This is the pyChess project by Timothy Myers.
The goal of the project is to create a chess engine that imports and exports 
partial games in the Portable Game Notation file format so that chess games may be
played over email.

It is being implemented in Python 3 as a learning tool.
This is stalled slightly right now. The game engine is fully functional and so is
the save game io. It is still not in in fully compatible PGN format however.

To Run:
./chess.py

Requires:
Python 3 installed
