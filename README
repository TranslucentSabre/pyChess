This is the pyChess project by Timothy Myers.
The goal of the project is to create a chess engine that imports and exports 
partial games in the Portable Game Notation file format so that chess games may be
played over email.

It is being implemented in Python 3 as a learning tool.

To Run:
./chess.py

Requires:
Python 3 installed
